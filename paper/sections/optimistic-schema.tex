\section{Processing fewer blocks}

\textsf{Leveraging an optimistic schema.}
In smart contracts, in order to ensure that users comply with the underlying
application's rules, certain actions need to be performed on-chain, e.g.
verification of data, balance checks etc.  In a different approach, actions
that deviate from the protocol are reverted after honest users indicate them,
not allowing diverging entities to gain advantages. Such applications that do
not check the validity of actions by default, but rather depend on the
intervention of other users are characterized ``optimistic''. In the Ethereum
community, several projects(refs) have been emerged that incorporate the notion
of \emph{optimistic interactions}. We observe that such a schema can be
embedded in the NIPoPoW protocol, resulting to significant performance gain.

We discussed how the verification in the NIPoPoW protocol is realized in
two phases. In \emph{submit} phase, the verification of the $\pis$ is
performed.  This is necessary in order to prevent adversaries from injecting
blocks that do not belong to the chain, or changing existing blocks. A proof is
valid for submission if it is \emph{structurally correct}. Correctly structured
NIPoPoWs has the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first block of the proof is the genesis block of the underlying
        blockchain.
    \item Every block has a valid interlink.
\end{enumerate}

Asserting the existence of genesis in the first index of a proof is an
inexpensive operation of constant complexity. However, confirming the interlink
correctness of all blocks is a process of linear complexity to the size of the
proof. Albeit the verification is performed in memory, sufficiently large
proofs result into costly submissions. This consists the most demanding
function of \emph{submit} phase. In Table~\ref{tab:valid-interlink-cost} we
display the cost of \textsf{valid-interlink} function which determines the
structural correctness of a proof in comparison with the overall gas used in
\textsf{submit}.

\input{tables/valid-interlink-cost}

\newcommand{\dispute}{\emph{dispute\ }} \noindent \textbf{Dispute phase.} We
observe that the addition of a phase in our protocol alleviates the burden of
verifying all elements of the proof by enabling the indication of an individual
incorrect block. This phase, which we term \dispute phase, leverages selective
verification of the submitted proof at a certain index, which, as a constant
operation, significantly reduces the gas cost of the verification process.

In the NIPoPoW protocol, when an proof $\pis$ is submitted by $\es$, it is
retrieved by a node $\ec$ from the calldata and the proof is checked for its
validity \emph{off-chain}. The critical observation we make here, is that, in
order to prove that $\pis$ is structurally invalid, $\ec$ only needs to
indicate the index in which $\pis$ fails the interlink verification. In the
protocol that incorporates \emph{dispute} phase, $\ec$ calls
$\textsf{dispute}$($\pisa$, $i$) for a structurally incorrect proof, where $i$
indicates the disputing index of $\pisa$. Therefore, only one block is
interpreted \emph{on-chain} rather than the entire span of $\pisa$.

Note that, this additional phase does not imply increased rounds of
interactions between $\es$ and $\ec$. In the case where $\pis$ is invalidated
by \emph{dispute} phase, \emph{contest} phase is skipped.  Similarly, in the
case in which $\pis$ is structurally correct, but represents a dishonest
chain, $\ec$ proceeds directly to \emph{contest} phase.

In Table~\ref{tab:dispute-cost} we display the gas consumption for
two independent cycles of interactions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Phases \emph{submit} and \emph{dispute} for the case in which $\pis$
is structurally incorrect.
    \item Phases \emph{submit} and \emph{contest} for the case in which
$\pis$ is structurally correct, but represents a dishonest chain.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
In Algorithm~\ref{alg:dispute-best-level}, we show the implementation of
\emph{dispute} phase with \textsf{submit} and \textsf{valid-single-interlink}
functions.

\input{tables/dispute-cost}

\noindent
\textbf{Isolating the best level.} As discussed, \emph{dispute} and
\emph{contest} phases are mutually exclusive. Unfortunately, constant-time
verification cannot be applied in a contest without increasing the rounds
of interactions for the users. However, we derive a major
optimization for \emph{contest} phase by observing the process of score
evaluation.

In NIPoPoWs, after the last common ancestor is found, each fork of the proofs
is evaluated in terms of proof of work score. Each level encapsulates different
score of proof of work, and the level with the best score is the representative
of the underlying proof. Since the common blocks of the two proofs naturally
gather the same score, only the disjoint portions need to be addressed.
Consequently, the position of the $\lca$ determines the span of the proofs that
will be included in the score evaluation process. Furthermore, it is impossible
to determine the score of a proof in \emph{contest} phase due to the lack of
knowledge of the $\lca$ block.

When $\pis$ is known, the score of both proofs is calculated. This means that,
after $\pis$ is retrieved from the calldata, the scores of $\pis$ and $\pic$ is
known to $\ec$, as well as the level in which each proof encapsulates the most
proof of work. We illustrate the blocks that participate in the formulation of
of a proof's score in Figure~\ref{fig:score-at-levels}. In the light of this
observation, $\ec$ only submits the blocks which consist the \emph{best level}
of $\pic$. The number of these blocks is constant, as it is determined by the
security parameter $m$, which is irrelevant to the size of the underlying
blockchain.

The calculation of best level of $\pic$ is an \emph{off-chain} process.
Naturally, an adversarial $\ec$ can intentionally dispatch a level of $\pic$
which is different than the best level. However, this is an irrational action,
since different levels only undermine the score of $\pic$. On the contrary, due
to the consistency property of \emph{hash-and-resumbit}, $\pis$ cannot be
altered. We denote the best level of $\pitr$ as $\pitrl$.

    \caption{Fork of two proofs. Colored blocks after the lca determine the
    score of each proof. Black blocks belong to the level that
    has the best score. Only black blocks are part of the best level of the
    contesting proof.}
    \label{fig:score-at-levels}
\end{figure}

The utilization of \emph{best-level} methodology greatly increases the
performance of the client, because the complexity of the majority of
$\textsf{contest}$ functions is related to the size of $\pic$. In
Table~\ref{tab:best-level-cost}, we demonstrate the difference in gas
consumption in \emph{contest} phase after using \emph{best-level}. The
performance of most functions is increased by approximately 85\%. This is due
to the fact that the size of $\pic$ is decreased accordingly. For $m=15$,
$\pitrl$ consists of 31 blocks, while $\pitr$ consists of 200 blocks.
Notably, the calculation of score for $\pitrl$ needs 97\% less gas. We achieve
such a discrepancy because the process of score calculation for multiple levels
demands the use of a temporary hashmap which is a storage structure. In
contrast, the evaluation of score of a individual level which is performed
entirely in memory.

In Figure ~\ref{fig:dispute-best-level}, we illustrate the performance gain of
the client using \emph{dispute} phase and best-level contesting proof. The
aggregated gas consumption of \emph{submit} and \emph{contest} phases is
greatly reduced to 3,500,000 gas. This is critical threshold regarding
applicability of the contract, since a cycle of interactions now fits
effortlessly inside a single Ethereum block.
