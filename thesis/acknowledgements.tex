I would like to thank professor Angelos Kiayias for giving me the opportunity
to get involved with such an interesting subject, and the knowledge I have
acquired thanks to his teaching all these years during my undergraduate and
postgraduate studies.

Special thanks to Dionysis Zindros and Kostis Karantias for the genuine
interest they showed for this project and their guidance throughout the whole
duration of my thesis. Also for the amount of time they spent, their decisive
contribution to key ideas, their valuable advice on writing code and text, and
the extended code review. I have learned a lot and I feel grateful that I had
the chance to work along these two.

I would like to thank my colleague and friend Andrianna Polydouri for all the
meaningful and helpful conversations over the last years, especially at the
topic of blockchains, which greatly facilitated this work, and also for her
patience to listen my frequent success and failure reports on the subject.

Thanks to my friend Dimitris Grigoriou for drawing the first blockchain I ever
encountered on the whiteboard.

Many thanks to my mentor and friend, Malonis Paterakis, for showing me
what it feels like to be a programmer, and teaching me how to open (and close)
VIM.

Finally, I cannot express my gratitude to my brother, Panos, for his support
over all these years, and for letting me to extensively use his couch.
